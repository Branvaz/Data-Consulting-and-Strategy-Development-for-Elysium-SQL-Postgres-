--Note: Unfortunately Tableau Public does not allow direct connections to databases. It also does not allow stories to have more than one graph attached.
--Thus, I was unable to use the SQL queries to make the all the appropriate graphs (such as how many action games Nintendo/Electronic Arts have made).
--Thanks for your understanding. Heres some visulizations I could make from CSV file I cleaned and aggregated on excel:

When thinking about how I wanted to present my findings, I used logical reasoning what exactly a stakeholder in Elysium would want to hear.

Lets start with cementing what region our marketing and sales team should prepare to campiagn in.
Below is a line graph allowing direct comparssion betweens the Global Sales of all regions
This graph is C. Sales Comparison by Region png. in this repository
NA was the clear outlier as I found with my SQl analysis. The rest of the analysis should have focus points on North America.

The best way to decide which genre to make our game is to see how each genre has dont in global sales. 
This Graph is D. Genre Sales Globally.png in this repository
This visulization supports my findings that focusing on an action and sports game (or combination) would be most efficent for our developement team

Lets make sure our team is confident in our genre choice
This graph is E. Genre Sales North America.png
Action and Sports performed with the highest sales in North America. The best options for our developement team if we release in NA region.

I was tasked with assisting in developing a buisness strategy. On SQL it was clear Nintendo and Electronic Arts were the best choices to mirror our plans off of.
This graph is F. Global Sales Across All Publishers.png
Nintendo and Electronic Arts both had staggering global lifetime sales. With Electronic gaming making over 50% of thier games action and sport (SQL), they are a great fit.

Lets make sure the team feels super comfortable spending resources disecting Nintendos and Electronic Arts marketing and sales campaigns
This graph is G. Publisher Sales In North America.png
Both companies did have amazing sales in the NA region.

Lastly, lets make the visal supporting why our developement team should make the deliverable for console
This graph is H. Global Platform Sales.png
The top 4 selling platform lifetime sales are consoles.

These graphs are enough to support my data analysis. My next step would be to put these graphs into a powerpoint, and get ready to present to the head 
of our various teams at Elysium.
